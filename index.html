              UBC Okanagan researchers, in collaboration with Project Literacy, Childhood Connections, and the Central Okanagan Early Years Partnership have launched a new research study, “Do Families Need to Power Down to Connect? A Study of Technology, Relationships, and Wellbeing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is to identify healthy and unhealthy patterns of technology use in families with young children.
            </p>
            <p>
              The survey is now closed to respondents. Thank you to all those who participated.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will be presenting some of the findings at two community events on November 27th. These are free and open to the public! If you would like to attend you can <a href = "https://familyscreentime.eventbrite.ca">register online</a>.

        <h2 class="mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-1">What was the purpose of this study?</h3>

        <p>
          The main goal was to develop a better understanding of the relationship between different types of technology use and parent, child, and family wellbeing. We hoped to identify patterns of both healthy and unhealthy technology use.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-1">What were the results?</h3>

        <p>
          We will be sharing some of our preliminary findings at two <a href ="https://familyscreentime.eventbrite.ca">community events</a> in Kelowna, on November 27th. The events are free and open to the public. We hope to see you there!
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-1">Two events on the same day? What is the difference?</h3>

        <p>
          The two events will be presenting the same information at different times and locations (so choose to attend whichever event best fits your schedule!).
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-1">Where and when are these events?</h3>

        <p>
          The morning event will be from 9:30–11 at <b>Hollywood Road Education Services</b> 1040 Hollywood Rd. The evening event will be from 7–8:30 at <b>The Innovation Centre</b> 460 Doyle Ave.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-1">What will be happening at these events?</h3>

        <p>
          We will be sharing preliminary findings of the study, including primary concerns parents express about screen time, reasons for screen time, and potential problems associated with parent and child technology use. A clinical child psychologist will provide suggestions for helping children develop healthy relationships with technology, and an industry representative will discuss the role of the private sector in ensuring the safety of online environments. There will then be a question and answer period with expert panel, followed by a reception with light refreshments.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-1">Do I have to register?</h3>

        <p>
          Yes. But registration is free and you can easily register online using <a href = "https://familyscreentime.eventbrite.ca">EventBrite</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-1">What do I do if I have more questions?</h3>

        <p>
          If you have more questions email Zak Draper the study coordinator at <a href="mailto:zakary.draper@ubc.ca">zakary.draper@ubc.ca</a>. He will be happy to answer your questions!
