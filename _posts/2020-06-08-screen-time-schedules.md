* Be a good role model with your own screen time.
* Turn off TV during meal times.
* Turn off background TV when no one is watching.
* Avoid using screens an hour before bedtime.
* Choose activities such as playing outdoors, reading or crafting over screens.

* Set limits on after-school screen time – for example, one TV program, and then outside to play.
* Have a few “screen free” days each week.
* Record favourite TV shows and watch them at times that don’t compete as much with active play – for example, when it’s dark.
* Talk to other adults who supervise your child about your limits on screen time. For example, if your child visits a friend’s house, you could ask the friend’s parent to let you know how much screen time your child has there. Then you can adjust how much screen time your child can have at home that day.
* Limit how much TV or other screen activity is “in the background”. If the TV is on in the background, it can still interfere with socializing and concentration.
