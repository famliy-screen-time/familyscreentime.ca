We have all either seen or heard of the Canadian Paediatric Society's overarching recommendations for healthy screen usage as it pertains to young children. But even with these resources available, the question remains - how do we put these guidelines into practice?

A disappointing trend in the available guidelines for young children's screen usage is that the focus of these recommendations is almost exclusively on what to do and what not to do - "no screens before age 2", "no more than 1 hour per day", "choose healthy programs", "set a healthy schedule". What is missing from these recommendations is **how** parents can go about accomplishing and adhering to these guidelines.

The following is a compilation of resources provided by multiple sources on the different aspects of healthy screen time for young children. This includes:

* Assessing whether your child is using screens in a balanced and healthy way
* Exploring whether screen use is becoming a problem
* Making screen time healthy and beneficial for your child
* Incorporating and encouraging physical activity through screens
* Being a good role model for healthy screen usage

## Is Your Child's Screen Routine Healthy?

On this issue, an [Australian parenting website](https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/play-learning/screen-time-media/screen-time) raises a very important point - instead of assuming that all screen time is unhealthy for children, it may be possible thatyour child's screen usage is in line with a healthy and balanced lifestyle. To find out if this is the case, ask yourself if your child is:

* sleeping a healthy amount of time with no issues
* physically healthy and developing
* engaged in daycare / learning activities
* connecting with other children
* enjoying other forms of play aside from screens
* learning and enhjoying themselves while using screens
* engaging in quality forms of screen time

Keeping in mind CPA's general guidelines for usage, if you are adhering to recommendations as best as you can and answered **"yes"** to most or all of these questions, it is suggested that your child is likely using screens in a healthy and balanced manner! Yay!



## Signs That Screen Use is Becoming Problematic

On the other hand, 

**How much is too much?**

Watch for signs that screen use is becoming a problem, such as:

* Your child complains about being bored or unhappy without access to technology.
* Oppositional behaviour when you set limits on screen time.
* Screen use is interfering with sleep, school or face-to-face interactions.
* Screen time is interfering with offline play, physical activities or socializing with friends and family.
* Negative emotions after interacting online, playing video games or while texting.

## Making Screen Time Healthy & Beneficial

**Work schedules**

Busy work schedules can also get in the way of finding time to play outdoors with your children.\
It might be helpful to talk with other parents or people in your neighbourhood about helping each other overcome this. For example, you could take turns to supervise a group of children playing actively outside on different days.

* Preview programs, games and apps before allowing your child to view or play with them. Organizations such as Common Sense Media can help you determine what's appropriate. Better yet, watch, play or use them with your child.
* Seek out interactive options that engage your child, rather than those that just require pushing and swiping or staring at the screen.
* Use parental controls to block or filter internet content.
* Make sure your child is close by during screen time so that you can supervise his or her activities.





Tips from HEALTHY FAMILIES BC: https://www.healthyfamiliesbc.ca/home/articles/screen-time-and-obstacles-physical-activity-children

* Set limits on after-school screen time – for example, one TV program, and then outside to play.
* Have a few “screen free” days each week.
* Record favourite TV shows and watch them at times that don’t compete as much with active play – for example, when it’s dark.
* Talk to other adults who supervise your child about your limits on screen time. For example, if your child visits a friend’s house, you could ask the friend’s parent to let you know how much screen time your child has there. Then you can adjust how much screen time your child can have at home that day.
* Limit how much TV or other screen activity is “in the background”. If the TV is on in the background, it can still interfere with socializing and concentration.

**How do I choose the right apps, videos or programs for my child?**

Whenever possible, make screen time an activity you and your child do together. Watch with your child and talk about what you’re seeing. To ensure quality content:

* Choose educational, age-appropriate and interactive programs and apps. Educational apps have a clear learning goal and encourage participation**.**
* Try out apps before your child uses them.
* Make sure your child watches programs you’re familiar with.
* Use a[media rating system](http://www.mpa-canada.org/home-entertainment/)to guide your viewing choices.

**MANAGE**screen use through plans, rules, and limits.

* Be present and engaged when screens are used and, whenever possible, watch together and talk about the content.
* Learn about[parental controls and privacy settings](http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/mediasmarts/files/tip-sheet/tipsheet_parental_controls_0.pdf).



Encourage**MEANINGFUL**screen use, so that time spent online serves a purpose.

* Make sure daily routines come first: face-to-face interactions, sleep, and physical activity.
* Encourage your child to watch programs that help teach, such as shows about nature, science, the arts, music or history.
* Help children and teens to choose content that’s appropriate for their age and stage.
* Be a part of your children’s media lives. For example, join in during video game play and ask about their experiences and encounters online.
* Ask your child’s school, after school program or child care centre whether they have a plan for digital literacy and screen use.

* Avoid using screens an hour before bedtime.
* Choose activities such as playing outdoors, reading or crafting over screens.

## Encouraging Physical Activity

Many sources have emphasized the importance of encouraging motor development and physical activity as a priority over screen time for young children. This[ website](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/healthy-lifestyle/physical-activity/screen-time-physical-activity) has put forth some tips on how we can utilize screens themselves to encourage activity in young children, including:

* Going for a walk with your child and taking photos to later look at, talk about, draw, etc.
* Watching videos about places you then visit with your child (i.e. the beach).
* Selecting screens for your child that encourage activity such as singing, dancing, and moving in general (i.e. interactive dancing games or virtual sports games such as Wii Sports).
* Transfering your child's favorite show into real-life (i.e. dressing up as a favorite character, or acting out scenes from the show).
* Taking breaks between screen usage to be active (i.e. jumping jacks during commercials together).



## Modelling Healthy Screen Time

As mentioned in a [previous blog post](https://familyscreentime.ca/2020-02-24-the-importance-of-modelling), it is important to be a role model to your children with the way you use screens yourselv. Consider that your child is watching you for cues on when it's OK to use screens and how to use them.

**MODEL**healthy screen use, because your kids are watching you.

* Review your own media habits: Plan time for hobbies, outdoor play and activities.
* Encourage daily “screen-free” times, especially for family meals and socializing.
* Turn screens off when not in use, including background TV.

Managing your child's use of screens and media will be an ongoing challenge. But by developing household rules — and revisiting them as your child grows — you can help ensure a safe experience.
