title: Putting Screen Time Guidelines into Action

But the question remains - how do we put these guidelines into practice?



A disappointing trend in the available guidelines for young children's screen usage is that the focus of these recommendations is almost exclusively on what to do and what not to do - "no screens before age 2", "no more than 1 hour per day", "choose healthy programs", "set a healthy schedule". What is missing from these recommendations is **how** parents can go about accomplishing and adhering to these guidelines.

WAYS YOU CAN USE SCREENS TO ENCOURAGE PHYS ED: https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/healthy-lifestyle/physical-activity/screen-time-physical-activity

Here are some ways to combine screen use with physical activity:

* Plan a walk with your child using a digital map.
* Take photos of interesting things you see on a walk. You can look at them later and talk about what you saw, or you could draw a map and add the photos to it.
* Video your child learning a new skill like hopping, riding a bike, or doing a new skateboard trick. You can replay the footage so your child can see himself learning.
* Watch videos set in places you’d like to visit together. For example, you could watch a video set at a beach, then go to the local beach.
* Choose videos or apps that encourage your child to dance and sing along, or games that involve moving, like dancing games or virtual sports simulators.
* Bring your child’s screen time interests into off-screen play. For example, your child could dress up as a favourite TV character or use dolls and figurines to act out scenes.
* Make use of natural breaks like advertisements or the end of game levels. For example, you could see how many star jumps you and your child can fit in before the ads finish.

Is your child:

* sleeping enough?
* physically healthy?
* engaged with school?
* connecting socially with family and friends, online and offline?
* enjoying a variety of hobbies and interests?
* having fun and learning while using screens?
* using quality content?

If you**answer yes to most or all of these questions**, your child is probably using screens in a balanced way as part of a healthy lifestyle.









Tips from FRASER HEALTH: https://www.fraserhealth.ca/health-topics-a-to-z/children-and-youth/physical-activity-for-children/screen-time-for-children#.Xt7EYi0ZPOQ

* Be a good role model with your own screen time.
* Turn off TV during meal times.
* Turn off background TV when no one is watching.
* Avoid using screens an hour before bedtime.
* Choose activities such as playing outdoors, reading or crafting over screens.



Tips from HEALTHY FAMILIES BC: https://www.healthyfamiliesbc.ca/home/articles/screen-time-and-obstacles-physical-activity-children



* Set limits on after-school screen time – for example, one TV program, and then outside to play.
* Have a few “screen free” days each week.
* Record favourite TV shows and watch them at times that don’t compete as much with active play – for example, when it’s dark.
* Talk to other adults who supervise your child about your limits on screen time. For example, if your child visits a friend’s house, you could ask the friend’s parent to let you know how much screen time your child has there. Then you can adjust how much screen time your child can have at home that day.
* Limit how much TV or other screen activity is “in the background”. If the TV is on in the background, it can still interfere with socializing and concentration.



They also note:

### Work schedules

Busy work schedules can also get in the way of finding time to play outdoors with your children.\
It might be helpful to talk with other parents or people in your neighbourhood about helping each other overcome this. For example, you could take turns to supervise a group of children playing actively outside on different days.

## **How do I choose the right apps, videos or programs for my child?**

Whenever possible, make screen time an activity you and your child do together. Watch with your child and talk about what you’re seeing. To ensure quality content:

* Choose educational, age-appropriate and interactive programs and apps. Educational apps have a clear learning goal and encourage participation**.**
* Try out apps before your child uses them.
* Make sure your child watches programs you’re familiar with.
* Avoid commercial and adult or ‘entertainment’ programming.
* Use a[media rating system](http://www.mpa-canada.org/home-entertainment/)to guide your viewing choices.





**MANAGE**screen use through plans, rules, and limits.

* Make and regularly review or revise a[Family Media Plan](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/media/Pages/default.aspx#home), including individualized time and content limits.
* Consider asking your child or teen to give you their phone at a certain time at the end of the day so they aren’t interrupted with phone calls or text messages during family time.
* Be present and engaged when screens are used and, whenever possible, watch together and talk about the content.
* Discourage media multitasking, especially during homework.
* Learn about[parental controls and privacy settings](http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/mediasmarts/files/tip-sheet/tipsheet_parental_controls_0.pdf).
* Obtain your child's or teen’s passwords and login information for devices and social media accounts, to help ensure safety online and to follow online profiles and activities if concerns arise.
* Speak with children and teens about acceptable and unacceptable online behaviours.

Encourage**MEANINGFUL**screen use, so that time spent online serves a purpose.

* Make sure daily routines come first: face-to-face interactions, sleep, and physical activity.
* Encourage your child to watch programs that help teach, such as shows about nature, science, the arts, music or history.
* Help children and teens to choose content that’s appropriate for their age and stage.
* Be a part of your children’s media lives. For example, join in during video game play and ask about their experiences and encounters online.
* Ask your child’s school, after school program or child care centre whether they have a plan for digital literacy and screen use.

**MODEL**healthy screen use, because your kids are watching you.

* Review your own media habits: Plan time for hobbies, outdoor play and activities.
* Never text or use headphones while driving, walking, jogging or biking.
* Encourage daily “screen-free” times, especially for family meals and socializing.
* Turn screens off when not in use, including background TV.
* Avoid screens at least 1 hour before bedtime, and keep recreational screens out of bedrooms.

#### **How much is too much?**

Watch for signs that screen use is becoming a problem, such as:

* Your child complains about being bored or unhappy without access to technology.
* Oppositional behaviour when you set limits on screen time.
* Screen use is interfering with sleep, school or face-to-face interactions.
* Screen time is interfering with offline play, physical activities or socializing with friends and family.
* Negative emotions after interacting online, playing video games or while texting.

* Preview programs, games and apps before allowing your child to view or play with them. Organizations such as Common Sense Media can help you determine what's appropriate. Better yet, watch, play or use them with your child.
* Seek out interactive options that engage your child, rather than those that just require pushing and swiping or staring at the screen.
* Use parental controls to block or filter internet content.
* Make sure your child is close by during screen time so that you can supervise his or her activities.
* Ask your child regularly what programs, games and apps he or she has played with during the day.
* When watching programming with your child, discuss what you're watching and educate him or her about advertising and commercials.



To ensure quality screen time:

Also, avoid fast-paced programming, which young children have a hard time understanding, apps with a lot of distracting content, and violent media. Eliminate advertising on apps, since young children have trouble telling the difference between ads and factual information.

Consider that your child is watching you for cues on when it's OK to use screens and how to use them.

Managing your child's use of screens and media will be an ongoing challenge. But by developing household rules — and revisiting them as your child grows — you can help ensure a safe experience.
