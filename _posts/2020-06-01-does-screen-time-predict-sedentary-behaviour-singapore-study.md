"Early childhood is a great time to establish healthy behaviours."

Could be other way around - children who are less drawn towards physical activity may gravitate towards screen time, and not that screen time is causing these children to be less active

Child care unaddressed factor



This study looked at data from just over **500 children**, which I believe to be a pretty impressive sample size - especially when research is done over a long period of time, since many people are likely to drop out of study as their schedules and time commitments change (in this study, almost 1000 children were initially included). 



Each child's movement was measured using a device called an **accelerometer**. This device is able to track not only when, but also how much a child is moving their body, and converts this into data about their level of movement and activity.





The actual difference: in the results of this study, we learn that children who were on screens for more than 3 hours per day were more sedentary than children who were on screens for less than an hour. 

It was only a difference of 41 minutes of sedentary behaviour. 

 Light physical activity: >3hr screen children did 28 less minutes of light physical activity.

Moderate to vigorous physical activity: >3hr screen children did 13 minutes less physical activity.

There were no significant difference in the amount of time children spent sleeping.





This study used a longitudinal design - meaning that they studied the same children when they were toddlers and when they were in kindergarten, in order to get more accurate results based on change within each child, and not comparing different children to one another. This is definitely an advantage of this study over others, which often limit the results they can get from a study by comparing children who may differ from each other in a number of ways OTHER than what the study is trying to look at.

As is an issue with many studies, information on children's screen viewing is based on reports from parents. This type of reporting comes with risks for inaccuracy because parent's are unlikely to remember each individual minute or hour their child uses screens. Also, if their child has accessed a screen without their permission, or with another caregiver or parent that was not discussed with them, this would not be included in their report. For these reasons, we can't 100% trust parent-reported data.

Each child's movement behaviour was measured over a period of 7 days. While this is definitely a longer, more informational time period than measuring a child's movement in only an hour or a day, it is still possible that a child may have had a "lazy week", or may have been affected by other factors in their life at that time other than screen viewing.
