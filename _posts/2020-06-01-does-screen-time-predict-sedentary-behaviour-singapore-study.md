"Early childhood is a great time to establish healthy behaviours."

Could be other way around - children who are less drawn towards physical activity may gravitate towards screen time, and not that screen time is causing these children to be less active

Child care unaddressed factor



This study used a longitudinal design - meaning that they studied the same children when they were toddlers and when they were in kindergarten, in order to get more accurate results based on change within each child, and not comparing different children to one another. This is definitely an advantage of this study over others, which often limit the results they can get from a study by comparing children who may differ from each other in a number of ways OTHER than what the study is trying to look at.
