Early childhood is a key developmental stage, and any factor that may have an impact on that development is important to know. A [recent study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2722666?guestAccessKey=879c6c87-141e-48f8-8c95-4d684600a644) is the first to provide evidence that screen time is one of those factors, specifically for performance on development screening tests. How did it come to this conclusion?

#### Longitudinal Studies

This was a longitudinal study, or a study conducted with the same participants over an extended period of time – in this case, four years from ages two to five. This type of study is important for establishing relationships between behaviours, especially when it comes to development.

Data were collected at three points – when the children were two, three, and five years old. Measurements included a developmental progress questionnaire and an estimate of screen time on a typical day, both reported by the mother.

#### Statistical Methods

By using a special statistical technique that can model the interactions between two variables at different times, the researchers could provide evidence for cause-and-effect relationships between developmental progress and screen time.

The results showed that there were statistically significant associations between higher screen time and lower scores on the developmental screening questionnaire later. As an example, higher screen time at two years was associated with lower developmental screening scores at three years. There were no statistically significant associations between lower developmental screening scores and higher screen time later. This suggests that higher screen time causes slower development, not the other way around.

#### Limitations

One limitation of this study, which applies to most research in the area of screen time, is that it only captures a moment in time. This study uses data collected between October 2011 and October 2016, and with technology changing and improving so quickly, the findings may already be outdated as new devices and behaviours emerge.

Another limitation is how screen time was treated as a variable. This study collected data on several other variables, including whether the child was male or female, household income, physical activity, and hours spent sleeping per night. These variables changed the strength of the effect of screen time on developmental screening scores, suggesting that children are not equally affected by screen time. This study also did not distinguish between different types of screen time.

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47026834) article that reported on the study points out that different national child research groups, including in the US, Canada, and the UK, have provided different guidelines for screen time among young children. This shows how research on the effects of screen time is still ongoing, but it can be confusing for parents who want straightforward advice. [The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-12/rcpch_screen_time_guide_-_final.pdf) in the UK does not suggest any hard limits on screen time based on age or hours per day, but it does offer some open-ended questions for families to consider:

* Is screen time in your household controlled?
* Does screen use interfere with what your family want to do?
* Does screen use interfere with sleep?
* Are you able to control snacking during screen time?

Questions like these will always be relevant, no matter the place or time.

#### Conclusion

What is the takeaway from this study? There is evidence to show that screen time has the potential to be harmful to child development. However, this is a complicated relationship that involves many factors, not just screen time by itself.

This study does not suggest that screen time is inherently bad. Instead, parents should be mindful of how their children are interacting with technology. Questions like the ones above can be used to help develop healthy screen time habits in the home.
