The Canadian Paediatric Society has provided thoughtful recommendedations for screen time in families with young children. You can [read the full article](https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/screen-time-and-young-children), which includes a discussion of the research that informed these recommendations.

In addition, they provided ten questions for families with young children to consider. We think these are worthwhile for families to consider.

## Ten Questions for Healthy Screen Time

1. What kind of screens are in your home (e.g., TV, tablet, computer, smartphone)? Which does your child use?
1. Is watching TV or programs/movies on other devices a shared family activity and a common way to relax? How often is a screen on in the background although no one is really watching?
1. Does anyone in the family use screens during mealtimes?
1. What do you watch with your child? What does your child watch alone?
1. Do you encourage or discourage conversation with your child while you are using screens?
1. Do you ever watch adult/commercial programming with your child?
1. Does your child use screens while you do chores around the home? Often? Sometimes?
1. Are there any screen-based activities in your child’s day care program? Do you know how much these are used?
1. Does your child use any kind of screen before bedtime? How long before bedtime? Is there a TV or computer in your child’s bedroom? Does your child take mobile devices into the bedroom?
1. Does your family have rules or guidelines for screen use that everyone understands and shares?
