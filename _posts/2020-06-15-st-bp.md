When a new and noteworthy study is introduced into the literature, it is important that we as readers evaluate it for its strengths and weaknesses, and take a closer (critical) look in order to decide for ourselves whether its conclusions can be believed without skepticism. So that's what we're going to do!



# The Study

Earlier this month, a Brazilian study was published that explored the possible associations between screen usage by preschoolers and motor skills. 











Findings

Strengths

\- Large sample (926)

\- 

Limitations

\- Cross-sectional research

\- Limited geographical sample

\- "excessive exposure to sedentary behaviours (e.g. screen media use)", - here he authors seem to equate sedentary behaviour to screen use, assuming that the two are one and the same.
