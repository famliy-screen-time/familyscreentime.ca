When a new and noteworthy study is introduced into the literature, it is important that we as readers evaluate it for its strengths and weaknesses, and take a closer (critical) look in order to decide for ourselves whether its conclusions can be believed without skepticism. So that's what we're going to do!



# The Study

At the beginning of the month, a Brazilian [study](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/cyber.2019.0238) was published that explored the possible associations between preschoolers' screen usage and motor skills. This study assessed children between 4 and 6 years old from 30 preschools in a single Brazilian city. Screen use habits, along with physical activity, sleeping habits, and other behaviours were assessed by interviewing each child's caregiver(s) and having them fill out a survey. The childrens' motor skills were measured using an assessment called the "Motor Development Scale", which was carried out over 30 minutes by health professionals. This scale, according to the researchers, was able to assess multiple aspects of each child's motor skills - including fine and global motor function balance, spatial organization, and temporal organization. Each child's performance in this interview (whether or not they could complete certain tasks) was combined into a score called the "General Motor Quotient" or GMQ, which was finally categorized into either "low motor skills" or "normal or superior motor skills".



# The Findings

A number of interesting findings emerged in this study, including the following:

* Lower motor skill scores were more likely for boys, children aged 5-6, and children born premature or with a low birth weight.
* Lower motor skill scores were more likely for children from middle- or lower-class families. (This is likely due to the fact that children in the upper classes may have more opportunities to participate in activities such as organized sports).
* Excessive screen use (over 2 hours per day) increased the risk of a low motor skill score by 72%.
* Inactivity increased the risk of a low motor skill score by 90%.
* Inappropriate sleep activity (defined by the researchers as either too low or too high) increased the risk of a low motor skill score by 33%.



# The Strengths

\- Large sample (926)

\- 

# The Limitations

\- Cross-sectional research

\- Not a diverse sample - while this study boasted quite a large sample, with children from a large number of preschools, it is still noteable that all of these children were from the same geographic region close to one city center - leading to a sample that was not very diverse in terms of location or economic class, as admitted by the researchers. This is an important limitation for us to remember because, most likely, you are reading this from Canada. ?

\- Motor skills dichotomized - why not continuous?



# The Takeaways

 "excessive exposure to sedentary behaviours (e.g. screen media use)", - here he authors seem to equate sedentary behaviour to screen use, assuming that the two are one and the same.
