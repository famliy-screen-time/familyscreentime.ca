When a new and noteworthy study is introduced into the literature, it is important that we as readers evaluate it for its strengths and weaknesses, and take a closer (critical) look in order to decide for ourselves whether its conclusions can be believed without skepticism. So that's what we're going to do!



# The Study

At the beginning of the month, a Brazilian [study](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/cyber.2019.0238) was published that explored the possible associations between preschoolers' screen usage and motor skills. This study assessed children between 4 and 6 years old from 30 preschools in a single Brazilian city. 











# The Findings

# The Strengths

\- Large sample (926)

\- 

# The Limitations

\- Cross-sectional research

\- Not a diverse sample - while this study boasted quite a large sample, with children from a large number of preschools, it is still noteable that all of these children were from the same geographic region close to one city center - leading to a sample that was not very diverse in terms of location or economic class, as admitted by the researchers. This is an important limitation for us to remember because, most likely, you are reading this from Canada. ?



# The Takeaways

 "excessive exposure to sedentary behaviours (e.g. screen media use)", - here he authors seem to equate sedentary behaviour to screen use, assuming that the two are one and the same.
