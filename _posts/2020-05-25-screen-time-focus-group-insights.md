Back in April, the Family Screen Time project researchers facilitated a focus group to hear from parents of young children raised without screen time, parents of children raised with early exposure to screens, and early childhood educators. 

What follows is a summary of what we learned from this focus group regarding four main topics:
1. Healthy Screen Time.
2. Screen Time Impacts.
3. Canadian Paediatric Society's Recommendations.
4. Suggestions for Improvement.

# Healthy Screen Time

When asked whether they thought that screen time had the potential to be healthy for young children, most focus group members thought so. It was agreed that screen time can be healthy for interaction and as a teaching tool. 

It was also noted that the quality of the screen time is very important—but that parents struggle to pinpoint what makes some screen time of better quality than others. I believe that this concern rings true for many parents, since the recommendations and guidelines for healthy screen time require that it is "good quality," but don't go into much further detail about what exactly this entails. Because of this uncertainty, I would recommend looking into my previous blog post about [what makes "good quality" screen time ](https://familyscreentime.ca/2020-04-07-what-makes-good-quality-screen-time)—which essentially boils down to interactivity, child-directedness, social elements, and active viewing.

Focus group members also agreed that in order to be "healthy," screen time should avoid taking time away from other activities (i.e. time spent outside/imaginative play) that support childhood development.

When asked what amount of screen time could be healthy for young children, some focus group members suggested that for ages 2-5, approximately 20 minutes of screen time per day was appropriate. However, it was also mentioned that providing screens for young children may be essential to give parents time to complete practical tasks (i.e. making dinner, cleaning, work, etc.).

# Screen Time Impacts

When it comes to the potential negative impacts of screen time, focus group members were concerned about:

* How easy it is for screens time to take over daily life.
* Reaction/judgment from other families (worries that others may look down on families that give their young children access to screens).
* Lack of research on long-term impacts of screen time, including the development of motor skills.
* Potential struggles with boredom, need for instant gratification, anxiety.

The group members also revealed some observed behaviours in their young children that concerned educators and parents, including:

* Developmental delays (shorter attention spans, aggression) related to technology use.
* Social issues (less verbal, less fluid sentences, impatience).
* Screens seeping into everyday life (for example, a child who has never seen a television program knows all about the show/characters from other children at daycare).
* Modelling of undesirable behaviours seen in screens (for example, a child shows aggression towards another child when modelling a scene from a children's movie).

While these trends are worrisome, it is important to remember that the only way to prove that these behaviours are happening because of screen time is through good-quality research. While the idea that children model behaviours that they see performed by others in real life and over screens is [well-documented](https://familyscreentime.ca/2020-02-24-the-importance-of-modelling) in research, whatever small amount of studies exist on developmental and social delays in children for the most part use small samples to make assumptions for a large population, and cannot be used to say that screen time *causes* these trends—even though this is often taken the wrong way by [news outlets](https://familyscreentime.ca/2020-01-28-screen-time-brain-development). 

# Canadian Paediatric Society’s Recommendations

In Canada, the most authoritative guidelines for healthy child screen time comes from the Canadian Paediatric Society (you can see their full article [here](https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/screen-time-and-young-children), with the recommendations located near the end). When asked what they thought of the quality and practicality of these recommendations, this is what the focus group thought:

* Overall, parents feel that there is a lack of recommendations available for them to follow regarding screen time and young children. Whatever recommendations do exist are often vague, just declaring what not to do instead of providing healthy alternatives or concrete ways to follow the recommendations.
* The focus group also felt that some of the CPS's recommendations are impractical, including the requirement that sedentary screentime (such as children sitting and watching TV) should not be a part of childcare. Some members thought that recommendations like these cannot always be followed because it is sometimes required in order to entertain children to give caregivers the time to get practical tasks done.
* In general, group members voiced the worry that if recommendations have too high of standards, they will just be ignored.

# **Where do we go from here?**

We concluded our focus group by asking about how screen time recommendations might be improved. The main themes emerging from that discussion was that recommendations should be **accessible** and **informative.**

* **Accessible**: focus group members thought that the information and recommendations on childhood screen time could be improved with more accessibility. If the recommendations and relevant, good-quality research was made more available to parents and caregivers of young children, they would be more likely to use this information to make healthy choices about screen time for their young children.
* **Informative**: focus group members agreed that CPS's recommendations should steer away from telling parents what not to do, and towards suggesting guidelines and ideas for healthy screen time—providing more information for parents this way. The focus group also mentioned the need for information on why these recommendations were put in place—including the research behind the recommendations, the benefits of following the recommendations, and the possible negative outcomes of not following them—the "why?" behind the recommendations.

After learning about the opinions, concerns, and recommendations voiced by other parents and educators of young children, do you have anything to add? Is there anything you disagree with, or would like to be added to this information?
