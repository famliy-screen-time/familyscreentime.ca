##### *A collection of insights, recommendations, questions and concerns that were voiced in a recent focus group consisting of parents and educators on the topic of screen time and young children.*

When it comes to screen time - including its guidelines for use, and its benefits and potential harms for child development - any relevant research is very new, and very sparse. Since the phenomenon of screen usage by young children is such a recent development in society, we haven't been able to learn from many long-term, good-quality studies telling us a definitive answer of how it will affect young children as they grow. In fact, one of the few things we know about the effects of screentime on young children is that *we don't know much at all.*

To learn more 



**Who’s here:**

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Early childhood educators noticing worrying trends in child behaviour

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Parents of young children raised without screen time

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Parent of older children raised with early screen time, wanting to learn

**Healthy Screen Time**

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Screen time can be healthy for interaction and as a teaching tool

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->The quality of the screen time is very important – but parents struggle to pinpoint what makes some screen time of better wuality than others.

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Healthy screen time should avoid taking time away from other activities (i.e. time spent outside / imaginative play) that support development.

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Suggested that for ages 2-5, approximately 20 minutes of screen time per day was appropriate.

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Noted that providing screens for young children may be essential to give parents time to complete practical tasks (i.e. making dinner, cleaning, work, etc.).

**Screen Time Impacts**

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Members were concerned about:

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->o<!--\\[endif]-->How easy it is for screen time to take over daily life

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->o<!--\\[endif]-->Reaction / judgment from other families

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->o<!--\\[endif]-->Lack of research on long-term impacts, development of motor skills

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->o<!--\\[endif]-->Potential struggles with boredum, need for instant gratification, anxiety

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Observed behaviours that concerned educators / parents:

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->o<!--\\[endif]-->Developmental delays (shorter attention spans, aggression) related to technology use

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->o<!--\\[endif]-->Social issues (less verbal, less fluid sentences, impatience)

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->o<!--\\[endif]-->Screens seeping into everyday life (example = a child who has never seen the show “Paw Patrol” knows all about the show / characters from other children at daycare)

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->o<!--\\[endif]-->Modelling of undesirable behaviours seen in screens (example = a child hits another child with a toy pan to model an identical scene in Disney’s “Tangled”)

**Canadian Paediatric Society’s Recommendations**

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Overall, parents feel there is a lack of recommendatinos for them to follow

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->When recommendations do exist, they are often vague

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Recommendations should add healthy alternatives instead of just declaring what not to do

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->The age range of 2-5 is too large / vague – suggested splitting it up into 2-3, 3-5

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Some recommendations are impractical (sedentary screentime not a part of childcare, avoiding screens for 1 hour before bed) and are often necessary for parents to “get things done”

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Worry that if recommendations have too high of standards, they will just be ignored

**Where do we go from here?**

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Emphasis on recommendations steering away from telling parents what not to do, and towards sugegesting guidelines and ideas for healthy screentime – providing more information this way.

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Information for how to reduce screen time if families are in over their head (“Digital Detox”) – a path forward for families who don’t meet recommendations – how to work towards meeting them\*\*.\*\*

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Provide more research on screen time effects, reasons behind the recommendations – the “Why”.

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Improve visibility of recommendations – pamphlets, etc.

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Less prescriptive focus, more informational focus while giving parents the power to make decisions themselves.

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Provide information on how to discern good quality vs. bad quality screen time.

<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\\[endif]-->Focus group members wished that they knew the social-emotional impacts of technolgoy as well as how their own screen time use wass affecting their children.
