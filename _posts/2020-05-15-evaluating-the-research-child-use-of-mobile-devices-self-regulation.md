We live in an age of information, where scientists and psychologists are constantly uncovering new tidbits of information about child development - which is undoubtedly extremely helpful to parents. But there are negative aspects to this constant stream of information, one of the main ones being that new and noteworthy findings are often taken as undisputable fact by readers who may be unaware of the possible limitations to the findings and how they came about.

When we look at eye-catching information that we may find in a new study, it is important for us as readers to look beyond just the title and the attention-catching results and dive deeper into what the study found, how the researchers found it, and all of the study's strengths and limitations considered together. This way, we are able to get the full picture surrounding a study, and can more accurately evaluate the study and its recommendations. 





* **Small sample size.** Data from only 56 children were analyzed. As I have mentioned in previous blog posts, it is very important when you are making assumptions about a large group of people that your results are based on a large sample of the group of interest. In this case, a sample size of under 60 is definitely cause for some skepticism regarding their findings. If you found in a study that 50 adults became irritable after drinking milk, would you apply this finding to the millions of other adults around the world?
* **Cross-sectional research.** It is important to note that this study was done in a "cross-sectional" matter, meaning that information was collected from these children at only one point in time. This means that any child's change over time due to screen usage cannot be assessed in this study. Ideally, what we would want from a study would be for children to be measured over long periods of time - and then compared to themselves - to see how screen time has affected each and every child on their own. In this study however, children had to be compared to others on measures of self-regulation. Using this method, there is the risk that whatever differences the study found could have just been differences in the children themelves - potentially due to other familial factors, parenting style, or personality, instead of screen use.
* **Non-randomized groups.** This is a rather complicated and science-y concept, but what it essentially means to the reader of any study is that 
* **Drawing extreme conclusions.** As noted in the article, one of the main take-aways from this study was that parents should consider delaying the introduction of screen time to very young children *whatsoever*, meaning that any and all forms of screen time should be avoided before the child reaches a certain age (it was not mentioned what age this would be). I believe that
