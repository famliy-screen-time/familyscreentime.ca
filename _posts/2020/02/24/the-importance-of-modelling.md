It's no secret that children learn by example. As the people they likely spend the most time around, children will pick up many important behaviours and habits from parents. When it comes to behaviours like screen use and physical activity, are you modelling healthy behaviours for your child to follow?

The concept of "modelling" essentially means that . 

Recent research (within the last 10 years) looking at the effects of parent modelling on their children's screen-use, physical activity, and healthy eating habits has revealed the following:

* A [study](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5868-11-54) looking at a large sample (1000+ families) found that time spent viewing screens for parents is strongly associated with child screen viewing both during the week and on weekends, with some unique interactions depending on whether the mother or father is modelling the behaviour to their daughter or son.
* Another [study](https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/27/1/152/2418042) on over 3000 children found that use of TV, DVDs, computer games and gaming consoles in both mothers and fathers were related to higher use of these platforms by children. It also found that a mother's modelling of outdoor activites was associated with higher outdoor activity in girls, and a father's modelling of TV and DVD use was related to higher screen use in boys. Same-gender modelling (a mother modelling to a daughter, or a father modelling to a son) influenced their children's screen viewing activity significantly.
* A [review ](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jobe/2015/546925/)of 30 studies found that in a child's early years, parental influences were strongly related to the child's physical activity and screen time. This study suggested that the parents' encouragement ad support could increase children's physical activity, and that parents reducing their own screen time could lead to lower user of screens by their children.
* A 2010 [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1440244009001510) found that parents' physical activity rates and a child's age were significant factors associated with children's rates of physical activity. 
* Finally, a [study ](https://cdn.journals.lww.com/jrnldbp/FullText/2014/07000/Role_Modeling_as_an_Early_Childhood_Obesity.4.aspx?casa_token=PDyO2eSdUEIAAAAA:kzEq1zeUtavp_TrA90EGjVz12GNSeu_EJnBOikzuVh1o20JWvemimvBiuL38pQr4JRoPTAqpM8SMoJpqsGUq4fI)of 1000+ children and parents found that higher consumption of fruits and vegetables by parents significantly increased their children's consumption of fruits and vegetables, and parents decreasing junk food consumption influenced the same decrease seen in children. Children who did not experience any modelling from parents, on the other hand, had an increase in junk food consumption and sedentary behaviour. These effects were not seen when teachers did the modelling instead of parents, suggesting that a child's parent is their main source of learning by example.

Especially by parents of the same gender. This suggests that when a child sees their parent - especially the parent that they identify with in terms of gender - do a certain activity, they are more likely to follow in their footsteps and do the same.
