It's no secret that children learn by example. As the people they likely spend the most time around, children will pick up many important behaviours and habits from parents. When it comes to screen use and physical activity, are you modelling healthy behaviours for your child to follow?



Research Round-Up:

https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5868-11-54 (time spent viewing screens for parents is  strongly associated with child screen viewing on both weekdays and weekends with mother/father/son/daughter unique interactions, study on 1078 families)

https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/27/1/152/2418042 (over 3000 children - both maternal and paternal TV/DVD viewing and computer/games console use were related to higher engagement in these screen-based activities in children. Furthermore, maternal modelling of outdoor activities was significantly associated with outdoor activities in girls (*P*< 0.001). In contrast, paternal modelling of TV/DVD viewing and computer/games console were significantly associated with these screen-based behaviours in boys (*P*< 0.001). - Same gender modelling i.e. father to son, mother to daughter, both parent's sedentary behaviour including screen viewing were associated with higher in children, whereas participation in sport, outdoor activities were higher in children when modelled by the mother - could be because they see more of mother)

https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jobe/2015/546925/ (systematic review of 30 articles, In the early years of life, some parental influences were significantly associated with young children’s PA and screen time with moderate to strong evidence. findings suggest that parents’ encouragement and support can increase children’s PA, and reducing parents’ own screen time can lead to decreased child screen time.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1440244009001510 (parental PA rates (coefficient 0.09, 95% CI 0.03, 0.16,*P*=0.01) and child age (coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.01, 0.21,*P*=0.03) were the only factors significantly associated with child PA rates. Younger children may stand to benefit from PA intervention, and encouraging parental involvement in preschool PA interventions may be useful for increasing PA levels in young children.

Intervention parents significantly influenced a decrease in children's junk food consumption (β = −.04,*p*< .05), whereas control parents significantly influenced an increase in their children's junk food consumption (β = .60,*p*< .001) from T1 to T2. Control children showed a significant increase in junk food consumption (β = .11,*p*= .01) and sedentary behavior (β = .09,*p*< .005) from T1 to T2. Teachers did not significantly influencepreschool-age children's nutrition or physical activity patterns from T1 to T2.
