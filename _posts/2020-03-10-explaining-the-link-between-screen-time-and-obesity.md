A large amount of research has established a clear link between screen usage and obesity in children. What exactly is behind this link? Do parents really need to prohibit screen usage to prevent child obesity, or is a happy medium possible?

#### The Research

In 2017, an international non-profit organization called *Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development* put out a compilation of recent research about the relationship between screen usage and child obesity, based on an article by the [American Academy of Pediatrics. ](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/140/Supplement_2/S97.full.pdf)

This research included studies establishing a positive correlation between child screen usage and increased risk of obesity - meaning that higher levels of screen use were related to higher obesity risk. Correlational research is not completely trustworthy, however, because it does not mean that one thing necessarily caused the other. This correlation between screen use and obesity could mean that a) screen use caused obestity, b) obesity caused screen use. or c) something else caused both of these things. 

However, not only did the research find a correlation between screen use and obesity, but a few "randomized controlled trials" - which is another name for a powerful study that is able to establish cause-and-effect relationships - found that overall, higher levels of screen time led to higher BMI's in young children.

Basically, what all of this research concluded was that *there seems to be a causal relationship between screen usage and risk for childhood obesity.*

### The Relationship

The **three important mechanisms** of the relationship between screen use and obesity are:

* Increased eating while viewing screens,
* Seeing advertisements for unhealthy foods that alter the child's preferences, and
* Disrupting sleep.

Let's go through each of these mechanisms one by one.

**Increased eating while viewing screens**: when children are engaged in screen-viewing, the article suggests that more high-calorie food and drinks are consumed - and that by repeating this behaviour, the screen can become a trigger or prompt for eating, extend the amount of time spent eating, or distracting the child from feeling full.

**Seeing advertisements for unhealthy foods**: in many types of mainstream media, advertisements often appear that glorify candy, fast-food restaurants, or other unhealthy snacks. These ads can impact children's food preferences, grocery requests to parents, and ultimately, their eating habits. 

**Disrupting sleep**: this mechanism takes some of the information about before-bed screen time and lower sleep quality from [a previous blog post](https://familyscreentime.ca/2020-02-10-screens-sleep), and takes it one step further - one of the consequences of your child's sleep being disrupted by screens could potentially be a higher risk for obesity. The article suggests that sleep disruptions can affect hormones related to appetite, and lead to more snacking and eating outside of mealtimes - which can all in turn lead to obesity.
