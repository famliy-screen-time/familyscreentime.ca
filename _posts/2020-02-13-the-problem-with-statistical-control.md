I have a confession to make. I really don't know all that much about screen time. Having spent a substantial amount of time becoming familiar with the research that has been conducted in this area, and having conducted some of that research myself, I have become convinced that *no one knows that much about screen time*.

You may be wondering to yourself, "now wait a minute, Zak. You *just* said that you were familiar with screen time research. How can you be familiar with the research and still not know much about screen time?" This is a fair question. This is a pretty trendy research topic right now. Substantial time and money have been invested by researchers, governments, and others, in attempts to better understand how technology is impacting—among other things—mental health, social relationships, and childhood development. The problem isn't a lack of research (or even a lack of investment), it is that research in this area is not leading to the accumulation of knowledge. In other words, we're doing lots of research, we're just not learning much from it.

Hopefully that is at least a bit frustrating. I know it is frustrating for me! But it is also a pretty bold claim and I wouldn't expect you to believe it without me sharing at least a little bit of evidence. Before I get into it, may I recommend cozying up with a nice warm blanket and maybe some relaxing nature sounds? Things are about to get frustrating...
