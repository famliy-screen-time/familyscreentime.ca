One of the most popular phrases in the discourse surrounding screen time and young children, whether from mainstream media or from research-based recommendations, is "good quality" screens. You will often read that screen time is not such a bad thing, as long as your child's time spent on it is limited and the media they consume is of "good quality". But what exactly makes some types of screen time more "good quality" than others?



An article posted by [Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/article/value-screen-time-toddlers-preschoolers/), which is a nonprofit organization that provides research-based information on a variety of topics to children and families, compiled a list of tips for choosing media that can potentially contribute to your child's development. 

Some good screens:

It’s important, they note, for parents to recognize that not all screen time is created equal. Some TV shows, games and apps are more developmentally appropriate for preschool children than others. And just as important as the choice of media itself is the role you play in*how*your child consumes it.

most important form of interactivity is what happens with[parents as they participate in toddler screen time](https://childmind.org/article/benefits-watching-tv-young-children/). “Simple screen time just with the child watching the show or playing with the app,” notes Dr. Cruger, “is far less valuable than when it also involves direct interaction with the parents.”\
\
*joint media engagement*, which means you’re going to interact with your child around screens just like you would interact with your child around any kind of media, whether it’s a book, or art material.”

the key word here is active screen time

[According to an Australian study ](https://www.ledevoir.com/documents/pdf/screen_time.pdf)on active and passive screen uses, there are actually two types of active screen use: physical and cognitive. Kids can actually get similar benefits to physical exercise when they play with active video game systems like the Nintendo Switch, XBox Kinect or Pokemon Go.

ecommends multi-sensory experiences: “There should be multiple inputs of stimulation — they’re looking, they’re listening and then they’re swiping. Or they’re taking a picture of something that’s real and they’re doing something with it.”

“One of the great uses of iPads or iPhones is communicating with friends and relatives who do not live nearby,” says Schwartz. “This is a*great*use of technology.”

An open-ended, responsive, choose your own adventure-style app is more likely to have educational benefits than one that is linear, experts agree. The play should be child-led, rather than app-led.

Dr. Lytle cites the classic saying that any toy that your child is playing with should be 10 percent toy, 90 percent child. “As with toys, that’s something we would suggest in an app. Things that are more open-ended allow a child to really create and be creative and interact with the app.”





Finally, the article emphasizes the fact that it is not the end of the world if your child engages in screen time simply for entertainment, as a treat, or to unwind - as long as this form of screen time is accompanied with healthy limits and boundaries.

even the best of them cannot compete with real life activities and human interaction.
