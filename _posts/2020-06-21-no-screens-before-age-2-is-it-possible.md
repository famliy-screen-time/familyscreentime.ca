Many parents struggle with fully adhering to guidelines on screen usage that seem unrealistic or unattainable. The most common one that parents seem to grapple with is the Canadian Paediatric Society's [recommendation](https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/screen-time-and-young-children) that exposing your child to screens before the age of 2 be completely avoided - similar to the American Academy of Pediatric's similar [recommendation](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/news-features-and-safety-tips/Pages/Children-and-Media-Tips.aspx) that screens be avoided before 18-24 months with the exception of video chatting. But how do recommendations like these play out in the real world of parenting? 

Aside from blog posts or personal anecdotes from other parents who are attempting to reconcile the guidelines with real life, it is difficult to get a complete, detailed, or "scientific" account of how childcare and screen usage collide. So, imagine my excitement when I discovered a 2020 article that fit the bill perfectly!

A mother documented her struggle with the "no screen" recommendation during her child's first 18 months of life.





This article is a very interesting one because it combines a researcher's perspective with the lived experiences of a parent to a young child.
