Many parents struggle with fully adhering to guidelines on screen usage that seem unrealistic or unattainable. The most common one that parents seem to grapple with is the Canadian Paediatric Society's [recommendation](https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/screen-time-and-young-children) that exposing your child to screens before the age of 2 be completely avoided - similar to the American Academy of Pediatric's similar [recommendation](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/news-features-and-safety-tips/Pages/Children-and-Media-Tips.aspx) that screens be avoided before 18-24 months with the exception of video chatting. But how do recommendations like these play out in the real world of parenting? 

Aside from blog posts or personal anecdotes from other parents who are attempting to reconcile the guidelines with real life, it is difficult to get a complete, detailed, or "scientific" account of how childcare and screen usage collide. So, imagine my excitement when I discovered an article that fit the bill perfectly!

In this 2020 journal article, a a recent UBC PhD graduate and mother documented her struggle with the "no screen" recommendation during her son's first 18 months of life. This article presents a very unique angle on the issue in that it combines a researcher's perspective with the lived experiences of a parent to a young child. 

If you have 22 pages worth of time to spare, [you can read the full article here](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/doi/10.1177/1468798420926623). If not, here is a short summary of some of the article's most interesting insights.





This child was born into what the author called a "high technology" household, where both parents owned and used screens regularly. They did not change their own practices once their son was born.

Pictures or videos of the author's son were not shared on any form of social media.



Followed Recommendations

chose high quality programming, always co-viewed, acoidance of fast-paced or violent content, TV was turned off when not in use. No screen usage at mealtimes or in the bedroom, or during famly or social time. While there were laptops and phones in the home, the child only used them for video chatting relatives.

Unfollowed Recommendations

buggest one - the child accessed screens before they were 18 or 24 months old (the first use was at 7 months)

Mother would watch Netflix with her son in the sleepless nights baby stage (not that he was paying attention)

Child was allowed access to children's TV shows and movies at 12 months - although this time was broken up with other activities such as reading or outside time

Smartphones were regularly used in the home, and often times the son observed this use, got a hold of the devices. In an example, the author discussed how her son used a toy telephone to show that he knew phones were for "texting" as well as calling.

Interacted with the camera app, by 1 year he could take photos, used snapchat filters together

AAP recommends avoiding "using screens as the only way to calm your child" - while it wasn't the only way, author did use it sometimes.  - shortly after one year, began handing her son a phone to calm him down while she was changing him

Would regularly give the son a phone disconected from mobile and Wifi services, or any internet apps. On this phone he learned to use the camera app independently and to navigate the device on his own (intro to DIGITAL LITERACY)

















TV was most frequently used device

While one parent was interacting with their son, it would o ften be the case that the TV was on for the other parent to watch sports. - this type of background tv was cited by AAP as a potential distraction to play



Digital Literacy

Guilt

Tension between the author's identity as a researcher, who had argued before for digital technology to be used in early education, and as a mother, who still found herself hesitant to include screens in her son's learning.









The main takeaway here is: if you are having trouble as a parent or caretaker trying to reconcile -????-  you are not alone!
