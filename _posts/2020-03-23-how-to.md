The internet is full of information, and we are constantly bombarded with social media posts, news articles, and blog entries that make bold claims with significant implications every day. How can we tell which of these claims to believe, and which are more fiction than fact?

# Red Flags

When sifting through your feed, these types of claims should have their truth questioned right off the bat:

## **No Source**

If someone shares a photo or status on social media that appears to be talking about the results of some sort of study or research, but does not follow it up with a link or reference to where they got this information, there is no reason to believe that the poster didn't just make it up! Posts like these should be either a) followed up with some hefty researching looking for a reliable source, or b) IGNORED.

Examples:

## Clear Bias

 If some sort of claim comes from an individual / group who is clearly biased on a certain topic chances are that they actively look for and post information about the negative effects of screen time, while completely ignoring or concealing the potential positives. Sources that obviously have a very strong opinion on the matter should be viewed with skepticism, as opposed to more neutral sources.

For example, if you see information on negative impacts of screens posted by a group called "*MOMS AGAINST SCREEN TIME*", or a claim that screen time has zero consequences posted by "*I HEART SCREENS*", it would be a good idea to look further into the claim and get both sides of the issue.

Red Flags:

* Infographics - photos shared with no link / source



If the post in question passes through each of these quality checks, your next (and most important) step is to get to the root of the claim and evaluate the information for yourself.

# Find the Source

When an article claims that "research" or "a study" has found something to be true, it is important to get right to the source - try your best to find the article. Often, while the whole study may cost money to access, there will usually be a short summary called an "abstract" that you can read for free - check this for:

* Sample size
* Effect size
* Non-experimental studies
*
