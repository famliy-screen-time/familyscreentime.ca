## What is this?

You have reached the Family Screen Time project website and blog. This website will provide updates on the status of the Family Screen Time project (described further below) and is a hub for trustworthy content related to screen time in families with young children.

In 2019, UBC Okanagan researchers, in collaboration with Project Literacy, Childhood Connections, and the Central Okanagan Early Years Partnership, launched the family screen time project. Phase I of this project has included:

- Researching the impact of screen time in Okanagan families with young children through online surveys and focus groups
- Sharing research findings at academic conferences and community events
- Holding a focus group with local stakeholders
- Creating the Family Screen Time website and blog

In March 2022, we launched Phase II of this project to better understand the impact of the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic on mothers and their young children (ages 2&ndash;5) in the Central Okanagan.
