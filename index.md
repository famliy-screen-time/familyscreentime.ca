## What is this?

You have reached the Family Screen Time project website and blog. This website will provide updates on the status of the Family Screen Time project (described further below) and is a hub for trustworthy content related to screen time in families with young children. Blog posts will be published regularly in the coming months.

UBC Okanagan researchers, in collaboration with Project Literacy, Childhood Connections, and the Central Okanagan Early Years Partnership, have launched the family screen time project. This project has included:

- Researching the impact of screen time in Okanagan families with young children
- Sharing research findings at academic conferences and community events
- Holding a focus group with local stakeholders
- Creating the Family Screen Time website and blog

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the purpose of this project?

The main goal is to develop a better understanding of the relationship between different types of technology use and parent, child, and family wellbeing. We hope to identify patterns of both healthy and unhealthy technology use.

We are also trying to share the important information with the community, which we have accomplished through free public presentations and this website.

### What were the results of the study?

We will share the findings widely after they have been reviewed and published.
